=======

Package btcutil provides Bitmessage-specific convenience functions and types.
A comprehensive suite of tests is provided to ensure proper functionality.
Package btcutil is licensed under the liberal ISC license.

This package was developed for bmd, an alternative full-node implementation of
Bitmessage which is under active development by Monetas.  Although it was
primarily written for bmd, this package has intentionally been designed so it
can be used as a standalone package for any projects needing the functionality
provided.

It is based off btcutil, which is developed by Conformal.
